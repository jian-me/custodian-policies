# Cloud Custodian Policies
A collection of Cloud Custodian policies used to configure public cloud controls.

# Getting Started
Start by downloading and installing the Cloud Custodian packages here:
https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/quickstart/index.html

Make sure you set up Custodian for your specific cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) and include other services, such as mailer.

These policies and scripts were created to demonstrate the capabilities of Cloud Custodian to configure common public cloud security controls. The policies are meant to be used in conjunction with other controls.
